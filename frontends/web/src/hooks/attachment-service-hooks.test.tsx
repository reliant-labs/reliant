// yours: scaffolded once, never touched again — forge will not overwrite this file
//
// Happy-path tests for the generated AttachmentService hooks. Written once, when
// no sibling test existed; this file is YOURS from here — forge never
// regenerates it, so edit freely (delete it and run `forge project rescaffold <path>` to
// get a fresh one).
//
// Each test covers the happy path of one RPC: the hook resolves against the
// mock transport, which is the floor that catches a renamed schema, a broken
// transport wiring, or a hook that no longer compiles. Extend with error /
// loading / empty cases as you build the page — see the `frontend-testing`
// skill for the four-state coverage rule.
